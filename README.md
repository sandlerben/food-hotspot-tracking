Food Hotspot Tracking
=====================

The application is running at http://food-hotspot-tracking.herokuapp.com

##About the project
Organizations such as the World Food Programme need a better way to identify food "hotspots,” the places with the most dire food shortages. Food Hotspot Tracking solves this problem by scanning Twitter for tweets with contents related to hunger in Kenya. Locations of relevant tweets are plotted on a heatmap, generating a visualization of food insecurity.

##How it works
Social media conversation (Twitter, for example) provides a real time information feed that captures changes in key food security indicators. After identification, WFP considers these ‘hotspots’ as places to zoom into for further investigation. 

##Why Kenya?
Kenya largely depends on rain-fed agriculture, with about 80 percent of its land is arid or semi-arid. 1.5 million Kenyans are acutely food insecure and will require immediate food assistance over the next six months. Moreover, Twitter usage in Kenya is among the highest on the African continent due to the proliferation of mobile devices and SMS.

##About the World Food Programme
Founded in 1961, the [World Food Programme](http://www.wfp.org/) pursues a vision of the world in which every man, woman and child has access at all times to the food needed for an active and healthy life. On average, WFP reaches more than 80 million people with food assistance in 75 countries each year. About 11,500 people work for the organization, most of them in remote areas, directly serving the hungry poor.
