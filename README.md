Food Hotstop Tracking
=====================

Displays a heatmap of food-insecure areas by parsing Twitter data. The application scans Twitter for tweetâ€™s with contents related to hunger and food scarcity in Kenya. The locations of relevant tweets are plotted on a heat map, generating a visualization of which areas have food insecurity.

For a running prototype of the app, go to http://food-hotspot-tracking.herokuapp.com/.

This app was developed by Ben Sandler, Max McCarthy, Yoni Nachmany, and Nancy Won at [Hack the Change 2014](http://www.hackthechange.org/).
